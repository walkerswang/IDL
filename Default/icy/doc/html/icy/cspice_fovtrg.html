   CSPICE_FOVTRG determines if a specified ephemeris object is within 
   the field-of-view (FOV) of a specified instrument at a given time.

   For important details concerning this module's function, please refer to
   the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/fovtrg_c.html">fovtrg_c</a>.
   
</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>
   
   Given:
   
   Parameters-
   
      SPICE_GF_MAXVRT    is the maximum number of vertices that may be used
                         to define the boundary of the specified instrument's
                         field of view. See SpiceGF.h for more details.
      
      MARGIN             is a small positive number used to constrain the
                         orientation of the boundary vectors of polygonal
                         FOVs. Such FOVs must satisfy the following
                         constraints:
      
                         1)  The boundary vectors must be contained within
                             a right circular cone of angular radius less
                             than than (pi/2) - MARGIN radians; in
                             other words, there must be a vector A such that
                             all boundary vectors have angular separation 
                             from A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians.
      
                         2)  There must be a pair of boundary vectors U, V
                             such that all other boundary vectors lie in
                             the same half space bounded by the plane
                             containing U and V. Furthermore, all other
                             boundary vectors must have orthogonal
                             projections onto a specific plane normal to
                             this plane (the normal plane contains the angle
                             bisector defined by U and V) such that the
                             projections have angular separation of at least
                             2*MARGIN radians from the plane spanned
                             by U and V.
      
                         MARGIN is currently set to 1.D-6.     
   
   Arguments-
   
      instrument   indicates the name of an instrument, such as a
                   spacecraft-mounted framing camera. The field of view
                   (FOV) of the instrument will be used to determine if
                   the target is visible with respect to the instrument.
      
                   The position of the instrument is considered to
                   coincide with that of the ephemeris object 'observer' (see
                   description below).
      
                   The size of the instrument's FOV is constrained by the
                   following: There must be a vector A such that all of
                   the instrument's FOV boundary vectors have an angular
                   separation from A of less than (pi/2)-MARGIN radians
                   (see description above). For FOVs that are circular or
                   elliptical, the vector A is the boresight. For FOVs
                   that are rectangular or polygonal, the vector A is
                   calculated.
      
                   See the header of the CSPICE routine getfov_c for a
                   description of the required parameters associated with
                   an instrument.
      
                   Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                   example, both 'CASSINI_ISS_NAC' and '-82360' are
                   accepted. Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                   significant in the string.
      
      target       is the name of the target body. This routine determines
                   if the target body appears in the instrument's field of
                   view.
      
                   Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                   example, both 'Moon' and '301' are accepted. Case and
                   leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
                   string.
      
      target_shape is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                   represent the shape of the target body. 
      
                   The supported options are:
      
                      'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model,
                                      with radius values provided via the
                                      kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                      having a name of the form
      
                                         'BODYnnn_RADII'
      
                                      where nnn represents the NAIF
                                      integer code associated with the
                                      body, must be present in the kernel
                                      pool. This variable must be
                                      associated with three numeric
                                      values giving the lengths of the
                                      ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.
      
                      'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.
      
                   Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                   significant in the string.
      
      target_frame is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                   frame associated with the target body. Examples of
                   such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and 'ITRF93'
                   (for the Earth).
      
                   If the target body is modeled as a point, 'target_frame'
                   is ignored and should be left blank. (Ex: ' ').
      
                   Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                   non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.
      
      abcorr       indicates the aberration corrections to be applied
                   when computing the target's position and orientation.
      
                   For remote sensing applications, where the apparent
                   position and orientation of the target seen by the
                   observer are desired, normally either of the
                   corrections:
      
                       'LT+S'
                       'CN+S'
      
                   should be used. These and the other supported options
                   are described below.
      
                   Supported aberration correction options for
                   observation (the case where radiation is received by
                   observer at 'et') are:
      
                       'NONE'         No correction.
                       'LT'           Light time only
                       'LT+S'         Light time and stellar aberration.
                       'CN'           Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                       'CN+S'         CN light time and stellar aberration.
      
                   Supported aberration correction options for
                   transmission (the case where radiation is emitted from
                   observer at 'et') are:
      
                       'XLT'          Light time only.
                       'XLT+S'        Light time and stellar aberration.
                       'XCN'          Converged Newtonian (CN) light time.
                       'XCN+S'        CN light time and stellar aberration.
      
                   Case, leading and trailing blanks are not significant
                   in the string.
      
      observer     is the name of the body from which the target is
                   observed. The instrument 'instrument' is treated as if it
                   were co-located with the observer.
      
                   Both object names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For
                   example, both 'CASSINI' and '-82' are accepted. Case and
                   leading or trailing blanks are not significant in the
                   string.
      
      et           is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
                   epoch.

   returns:

      visibl       is true if 'target' is fully or partially in the
                   field-of-view of 'instrument' at the time 'et'. Otherwise,

   Example(1):
   
      A spectacular picture was taken by Cassini's
      narrow-angle camera on Oct. 6, 2010 that shows
      six of Saturn's moons. Let's verify that the moons
      in the picture are Epimetheus, Atlas, Daphnis, Pan,
      Janus, and Enceladus.
