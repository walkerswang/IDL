   CSPICE_OCCULT determines the occultation condition (not occulted,
   partially, etc.) of one target relative to another target as seen
   by an observer at a given time.

   For important details concerning this module's function, please refer to
   the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/occult_c.html">occult_c</a>.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>
   
   Given:
   
      target1    is the name of the first target body. Both object
                 names and NAIF IDs are accepted. For example, both
                 'Moon' and '301' are accepted. 
      
      shape1     is a string indicating the geometric model used to
                 represent the shape of the first target body. 
         
                 The supported options are:
         
                    'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model
                                    with radius values provided via the
                                    kernel pool. A kernel variable
                                    having a name of the form
         
                                       'BODYnnn_RADII'
         
                                    where nnn represents the NAIF
                                    integer code associated with the
                                    body, must be present in the kernel
                                    pool. This variable must be
                                    associated with three numeric
                                    values giving the lengths of the
                                    ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes.
         
                    'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point.
                                    When a point target is specified,
                                    the occultation type must be
                                    set to 'ANY'.
         
                 At least one of the target bodies 'target1' or 'target2'
                 must be modeled as an ellipsoid.
         
                 Case and leading or trailing blanks are not
                 significant in the string.
      
      frame1     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                 frame associated with the first target body. Examples
                 of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and
                 'ITRF93' (for the Earth).
         
                 If the first target body is modeled as a point, 'frame1'
                 should be left blank (Ex: ' ').
         
                 Case and leading or trailing blanks bracketing a
                 non-blank frame name are not significant in the string.
      
      target2    is the name of the second target body. See the description of
                 'target1' above for more details.
      
      shape2     is the shape specification for the body designated
                 by 'target2'. See the description of 'shape1' above for
                 details.
      
      frame2     is the name of the body-fixed, body-centered reference
                 frame associated with the second target body. See the
                 description of 'frame1' above for more details.
         
      abcorr     indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
                 the state of each target body to account for one-way
                 light time. Stellar aberration corrections are
                 ignored if specified, since these corrections don't
                 improve the accuracy of the occultation determination.
         
                 See the header of the SPICE routine spkezr_c for a
                 detailed description of the aberration correction
                 options. For convenience, the options supported by
                 this routine are listed below:
         
                    'NONE'     Apply no correction.
         
                    'LT'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation.
         
                    'CN'       &quot;Reception&quot; case: converged
                               Newtonian light time correction.
         
                    'XLT'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: correct for
                               one-way light time using a Newtonian
                               formulation.
         
                    'XCN'      &quot;Transmission&quot; case: converged
                               Newtonian light time correction.
         
                 Case and blanks are not significant in the string
                 'abcorr'.
      
      observer   is the name of the body from which the occultation
                 is observed. See the description of 'target1' for more
                 details.
      
      time       is the observation time in seconds past the J2000
                 epoch.

                     occulted by) the second target.

   For many purposes, modeling extended bodies as triaxial
   ellipsoids is adequate for determining whether one body is
   occulted by another as seen from a specified observer.
