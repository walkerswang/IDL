   CSPICE_SUBSOL determines the coordinates of the sub-solar 
   point on a target body as seen by a specified observer 
   at a specified epoch,  optionally corrected for planetary 
   (light time) and stellar aberrations.

   Deprecated: This routine has been superseded by the routine 
   <a href="cspice_subslr.html">cspice_subslr</a>. This routine is supported for purposes of
   backward compatibility only.
   
   For important details concerning this module's function, please refer to
   the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/subsol_c.html">subsol_c</a>.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>
   
   Given:
   
      method   the scalar sting specifying the computation method 
               to be used.  The choices are: 
 
                  'Near point'    The sub-solar point is defined 
                                  as the nearest point on the 
                                  target to the sun.  
 
                  'Intercept'     The sub-observer point is defined
                                  as the target surface intercept of
                                  the line containing the target's
                                  center and the sun's center.
                   
               In both cases, the intercept computation treats the 
               surface of the target body as a triaxial ellipsoid. 
               The ellipsoid's radii must be available in the kernel 
               pool. 
 
               Neither case nor white space are significant in  
               method.  For example, the string ' NEARPOINT' is  
               valid.                  
 
 
      target   the scalar sting describing the name of the target body.
               'target' is case-insensitive, and leading and trailing
               blanks in 'target' are not significant. Optionally, you 
               may supply a string containing the integer ID code for 
               the object. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are legitimate
               strings that indicate the moon is the target body.
 
               This routine assumes that the target body is modeled by
               a tri-axial ellipsoid, and that a PCK file containing
               its radii has been loaded into the kernel pool via
               <a href="cspice_furnsh.html">cspice_furnsh</a>. 
 
      et       the double precision scalar ephemeris time 
               expressed as ephemeris seconds past J2000 at which 
               the sub-solar point on the target body is to be 
               computed. 
 
      abcorr   the scalar string identifying the aberration corrections to
               apply when computing the observer-target state.  'abcorr'
               may be any of the following.
 
                  'NONE'   Apply no correction. Return the 
                           geometric sub-solar point on the target 
                           body. 
 
                  'LT'     Correct for planetary (light time) 
                           aberration.  Both the state and rotation 
                           of the target body are corrected for one  
                           way light time from target to observer. 
 
                           The state of the sun relative to the  
                           target is corrected for one way light 
                           from the sun to the target; this state 
                           is evaluated at the epoch obtained by 
                           retarding et by the one way light time 
                           from target to observer. 
 
                  'LT+S'   Correct for planetary (light time) and 
                           stellar aberrations.  Light time  
                           corrections are the same as in the 'LT' 
                           case above.  The target state is  
                           additionally corrected for stellar 
                           aberration as seen by the observer, and 
                           the sun state is corrected for stellar 
                           aberration as seen from the target.  
 
                  'CN'     Converged Newtonian light time correction.
                           In solving the light time equation, the 'CN'
                           correction iterates until the solution
                           converges (three iterations on all supported
                           platforms). Whether the 'CN+S' solution is
                           substantially more accurate than the 'LT'
                           solution depends on the geometry of the
                           participating objects and on the accuracy of
                           the input data. In all cases this routine
                           will execute more slowly when a converged
                           solution is computed. See the Particulars
                           section of CSPICE_SPKEZR for a discussion of
                           precision of light time corrections.
 
                           Light time corrections are applied as in the
                           'LT' case.
                     
                  'CN+S'   Converged Newtonian light time correction
                           and stellar aberration correction. Light
                           time and stellar aberration corrections are
                           applied as in the 'LT+S' case.

      obsrvr   the scalar sting describing the name of the observing body. 
               This is typically a spacecraft, the earth, or a surface point 
               on the earth.  `obsrvr' is case-insensitive, and leading and 
               trailing blanks in `obsrvr' are not significant. 
               Optionally, you may supply a string containing the 
               integer ID code for the object.  For example both 
               'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate strings that indicate 
               the earth is the observer. 
   
   the call:
   
      <b>cspice_subsol</b>, method, target, et, abcorr, obsrvr, spoint
   
   returns:
   
      spoint   the double-precision 3-vector containing the 
               coordinates of the sub solar point on 'target'
               as seen by 'obsrvr' relative to the body-fixed 
               frame of 'target'

   The difference between the two position vectors results from the

</pre><h4><a name="Particulars">Particulars</a></h4><pre>

   <b>cspice_subsol</b> computes the sub-solar point on a target body, as seen by 
   a specified observer. 
 
   There are two different popular ways to define the sub-solar point:
   &quot;nearest point on target to the sun&quot; or &quot;target surface intercept of
   line containing target and sun.&quot;  These coincide when the target is
   spherical and generally are distinct otherwise.
 
   When comparing sub-point computations with results from sources 
   other than SPICE, it's essential to make sure the same geometric 
   definitions are used.
