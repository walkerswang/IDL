   CSPICE_GFOCLT determines time intervals when an observer sees one target
   body occulted by, or in transit across, another.  

   For important details concerning this module's function, please refer to
   the CSPICE routine <a href="../cspice/gfoclt_c.html">gfoclt_c</a>.

</pre><h4><a name="I/O">I/O</a></h4><pre>

   Given:

      Parameters-

      All parameters described here are declared in the header file
      SpiceGF.h. See that file for parameter values.

      SPICE_GF_CNVTOL     

               is the convergence tolerance used for finding endpoints of
               the intervals comprising the result window.
               SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is used to determine when binary searches
               for roots should terminate: when a root is bracketed
               within an interval of length SPICE_GF_CNVTOL, the root is
               considered to have been found.
 
               The accuracy, as opposed to precision, of roots found 
               by this routine depends on the accuracy of the input 
               data. In most cases, the accuracy of solutions will be 
               inferior to their precision.


      Arguments-

      occtyp   the scalar string naming the type of occultation to find.
               Note that transits are considered to be a type of
               occultation.      

               Supported values and corresponding definitions are: 
 
                  'FULL'               denotes the full occultation 
                                       of the body designated by  
                                       'back' by the body designated 
                                       by 'front', as seen from 
                                       the location of the observer. 
                                       In other words, the occulted 
                                       body is completely invisible 
                                       as seen from the observer's 
                                       location. 
 
                  'ANNULAR'            denotes an annular 
                                       occultation: the body 
                                       designated by 'front' blocks 
                                       part of, but not the limb of, 
                                       the body designated by 'back', 
                                       as seen from the location of 
                                       the observer. 
 
                  'PARTIAL'            denotes a partial, 
                                       non-annular occultation: the 
                                       body designated by 'front' 
                                       blocks part, but not all, of 
                                       the limb of the body 
                                       designated by 'back', as seen 
                                       from the location of the 
                                       observer. 
 
                  'ANY'                denotes any of the above three 
                                       types of occultations: 
                                       'PARTIAL', 'ANNULAR', or 
                                       'FULL'. 
  
                                       'ANY' should be used to search 
                                       for times when the body  
                                       designated by 'front' blocks 
                                       any part of the body designated 
                                       by 'back'. 
 
                                       The option 'ANY' must be used 
                                       if either the front or back 
                                       target body is modeled as 
                                       a point. 
 
               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in
               the string 'occtyp'.

      front    the scalar string naming the target body that occults---that 
               is, passes in front of---the other. Optionally, you may 
               supply the integer NAIF ID code for the body as a 
               string. For example both 'MOON' and '301' are 
               legitimate strings that designate the Moon. 
 
               The 'front' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading 
               and trailing blanks.
 
      fshape   the scalar string naming the geometric model used 
               to represent the shape of the front target body. The 
               supported options are: 
 
                 'ELLIPSOID'     Use a triaxial ellipsoid model
                                 with radius values provided from the 
                                 kernel pool. A kernel variable  
                                 having a name of the form 
 
                                    'BODYnnn_RADII'  
 
                                 where nnn represents the NAIF 
                                 integer code associated with the 
                                 body, must be present in the kernel 
                                 pool. This variable must be 
                                 associated with three numeric 
                                 values giving the lengths of the 
                                 ellipsoid's X, Y, and Z semi-axes. 
 
                 'POINT'         Treat the body as a single point. 
                                 When a point target is specified, 
                                 the occultation type must be 
                                 set to 'ANY'. 
                                  
               At least one of the target bodies 'front' and 'back' must 
               be modeled as an ellipsoid. 
 
               The 'fshape' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading 
               and trailing blanks.
 
      fframe   the scalar string naming the body-fixed, body-centered 
               reference frame associated with the front target body. Examples 
               of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) and 
               'ITRF93' (for the Earth). 
 
               If the front target body is modeled as a point, 'fframe' 
               should be left empty or blank. 
 
               The 'fframe' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading 
               and trailing blanks.
 
      back     the scalar string naming the target body that is occulted 
               by---that is, passes in back of---the other. 
               Optionally, you may supply the integer NAIF ID code 
               for the body as a string. For example both 'MOON' and 
               '301' are legitimate strings that designate the Moon. 
 
               The 'back' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading 
               and trailing blanks.
 
      bshape   the string scalar naming the shape specification for the body 
               designated by 'back'. The supported options are those for
               'fshape'. See the description of 'fshape' above for
                details.

      bframe   the scalar string naming the body-fixed, body-centered reference 
               frame associated with the ''back'' target body. 
               Examples of such names are 'IAU_SATURN' (for Saturn) 
               and 'ITRF93' (for the Earth). 
 
               If the back target body is modeled as a point, 'bframe' 
               should be left empty or blank. 
 
               The 'bframe' string lacks sensitivity to case, leading 
               and trailing blanks.

      abcorr   indicates the aberration corrections to be applied to
               the state of the target body to account for one-way
               light time.  Stellar aberration corrections are
               ignored if specified, since these corrections don't
               improve the accuracy of the occultation determination.
   
               This routine accepts the same aberration corrections as does 
               the CSPICE routine spkezr_c. See the header of spkezr_c for a
               detailed description of the aberration correction options.
               For convenience, the options are listed below:

                  'NONE'     Apply no correction.   

                  'LT'       'Reception' case:  correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'LT+S'     'Reception' case:  correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'CN'       'Reception' case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'CN+S'     'Reception' case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

                  'XLT'      'Transmission' case:  correct for
                             one-way light time using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XLT+S'    'Transmission' case:  correct for
                             one-way light time and stellar
                             aberration using a Newtonian
                             formulation.

                  'XCN'      'Transmission' case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time correction.

                  'XCN+S'    'Transmission' case:  converged
                             Newtonian light time and stellar
                             aberration corrections.

               The 'abcorr' string lacks sensitivity to case, and to embedded, 
               leading and trailing blanks.

      obsrvr   the scalar string naming the observing body. Optionally, you
               may supply the ID code of the object as an integer string.
               For example, both 'EARTH' and '399' are legitimate 
               strings to supply to indicate the observer is Earth.

               Case and leading or trailing blanks are not significant in 
               the string 'obsrvr'.

      step     a double precision value defining the step size to use in
               the search. 'step' must be shorter than any interval, 
               within the confinement window, over which the specified 
               occultation condition is met. In other words, 'step' must 
               be shorter than the shortest occultation event that the user
               wishes to detect; 'step' must also be shorter than the
               shortest time interval between two occultation events that
               occur within the confinement window (see below). However, 
               'step' must not be *too* short, or the search will take 
               an unreasonable amount of time.

               The choice of 'step' affects the completeness but not
               the precision of solutions found by this routine; the
               precision is controlled by the convergence tolerance.
               See the discussion of the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL for
               details.

               'step' has units of TDB seconds. 

      cnfine   a double precision SPICE window that confines the time period
               over which the specified search is conducted. 'cnfine' may 
               consist of a single interval or a collection of intervals.  

               In some cases the confinement window can be used to greatly 
               reduce the time period that must be searched for the desired
               solution. See the Particulars section below for further 
               discussion.
              
               See the Examples section below for a code example 
               that shows how to create a confinement window.

   the call:

      <b>cspice_gfoclt</b>, occtyp, front, fshape, fframe, $
                     back, bshape, bframe,          $
                     abcorr, obsrvr, step, cnfine, result             
 
 returns:

      result   the double precision SPICE window of intervals, contained 
               within the confinement window 'cnfine', on which the specified
               constraint is satisfied.
 
               If 'result' is non-empty on input, its contents
               will be discarded before <b>cspice_gfoclt</b> conducts its
               search.
              
               'result' must be declared and initialized with sufficient
               size to capture the full set of time intervals 
               within the search region on which the specified constraint 
               is satisfied.
 
               If no times within the confinement window satisfy the
               constraint, 'result' will be returned with a
               cardinality of zero.

   The numerical results shown for these examples may differ across
   platforms. The results depend on the SPICE kernels used as
   input, the compiler and supporting libraries, and the machine
   specific arithmetic implementation.

   Example(1):

      Find occultations of the Sun by the Moon (that is, solar
      eclipses)as seen from the center of the Earth over the month
      December, 2001.
 
      Use light time corrections to model apparent positions of Sun

   Example(2):

      Find occultations of Titan by Saturn or of Saturn by
      Titan as seen from the center of the Earth over the
      last three months of 2008. Search for every type
      of occultation.

      Use light time corrections to model apparent positions of
      Saturn and Titan. Stellar aberration corrections are not
      specified because they don't affect occultation computations.

   This routine provides a simple interface for conducting searches for 
   occultation events.
 
   This routine determines a set of one or more time intervals 
   within the confinement window when a specified type of 
   occultation occurs. The resulting set of intervals is returned as 
   a Icy window. 
 
   Below we discuss in greater detail aspects of this routine's 
   solution process that are relevant to correct and efficient 
   use of this routine in user applications. 

   The Search Process 
   ================== 
 
   The search for occultations is treated as a search for state 
   transitions: times are sought when the state of the `back' body 
   changes from &quot;not occulted&quot; to &quot;occulted&quot; or vice versa.

   ========= 
 
   Each interval of the confinement window is searched as follows: 
   first, the input step size is used to determine the time 
   separation at which the occultation state will be sampled. 
   Starting at the left endpoint of an interval, samples will be 
   taken at each step. If a state change is detected, a root has 
   been bracketed; at that point, the &quot;root&quot;--the time at which the 
   state change occurs---is found by a refinement process, for 
   example, by a binary search. 
 
   Note that the optimal choice of step size depends on the lengths 
   of the intervals over which the occultation state is constant: 
   the step size should be shorter than the shortest occultation 
   duration and the shortest period between occultations, within 
   the confinement window. 
 
   Having some knowledge of the relative geometry of the targets and 
   observer can be a valuable aid in picking a reasonable step size. 
   In general, the user can compensate for lack of such knowledge by 
   picking a very short step size; the cost is increased computation 
   time. 
 
   Note that the step size is not related to the precision with which 
   the endpoints of the intervals of the result window are computed. 
   That precision level is controlled by the convergence tolerance. 
 
   Convergence Tolerance
   =====================

   As described above, the root-finding process used by this routine
   involves first bracketing roots and then using a search process
   to locate them. &quot;Roots&quot; are both times when local extrema are
   attained and times when the distance function is equal to a
   reference value. All endpoints of the intervals comprising the
   result window are either endpoints of intervals of the
   confinement window or roots.

   Once a root has been bracketed, a refinement process is used to
   narrow down the time interval within which the root must lie.
   This refinement process terminates when the location of the root
   has been determined to within an error margin called the
   &quot;convergence tolerance.&quot; The convergence tolerance used by this
   routine is set by the parameter SPICE_GF_CNVTOL.

   The value of SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is set to a &quot;tight&quot; value so that the 
   tolerance doesn't become the limiting factor in the accuracy of 
   solutions found by this routine. In general the accuracy of input 
   data will be the limiting factor. 
 
   The user may change the convergence tolerance from the default 
   SPICE_GF_CNVTOL value by calling the routine <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>, e.g. 
 
      <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a>, tolerance value in seconds
      
   Call <a href="cspice_gfstol.html">cspice_gfstol</a> prior to calling this routine. All subsequent 
   searches will use the updated tolerance value. 
 
   Setting the tolerance tighter than SPICE_GF_CNVTOL is unlikely to be 
   useful, since the results are unlikely to be more accurate. 
   Making the tolerance looser will speed up searches somewhat, 
   since a few convergence steps will be omitted. However, in most 
   cases, the step size is likely to have a much greater affect on 
   processing time than would the convergence tolerance. 
 
   The Confinement Window 
   ====================== 
 
   The simplest use of the confinement window is to specify a time 
   interval within which a solution is sought. However, the 
   confinement window can, in some cases, be used to make searches 
   more efficient. Sometimes it's possible to do an efficient search 
   to reduce the size of the time period over which a relatively 
   slow search of interest must be performed.
